# Regression and classification-hands-on-assignment-2
Project Overview
In this project, I have built both classification and regression models using the Income dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore and predict income levels using different machine learning techniques.
Models Developed

Classification Models:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

rtandom forest



Regression Models:
Linear Regression

decision tree

random forest 

gradient boosting 


Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.
